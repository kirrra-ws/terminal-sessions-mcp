    //   - No marker line is typed into the PTY while the command runs, so a
    //     command that reads stdin (read, REPLs, ssh...) can't swallow the
    //     marker line and force a full-timeout wait.
    //   - The marker string is SPLIT in the echo command ("<<<EXI""T:...), so
    //     no echoed/redisplayed copy of the typed line ever contains a
    //     contiguous marker — only the shell executing the echo produces one.
    //     (Terminal echo comes back in several forms — tty echo, readline
    //     redisplay, soft wraps — which no exact-string filter survives.)

   * nothing: the shell behind the one that asked, when that one has gone, as
   * when an ssh connection drops between the marker and the lines, or a shell
   * an earlier command started in front of it meanwhile. So does a child
   * that inherited the variable (exported under `set -a`), since its pid
   * differs. A shell that replaced the asking one with `exec` keeps its pid,
   * and the variables too if they were exported, as under `set -a`, and then
   * runs the body, as does a subshell of the asking one, which keeps both. A
   * line after the first also runs only where the body variable is set and
   * holds as many characters as the lines before it typed, `typed` (the text
   * is ASCII, so a shell counting characters or bytes agrees; the check is of
   * the length, not the text), and prints the gone marker otherwise: a line
   * that reached another shell, or was cut or taken by something else
   * reading the terminal, leaves a body that is never run, instead of one
   * with a gap. The variable is tested for being set before its length is
   * read, so under `set -u` a line whose first line never arrived prints the
   * gone marker too, where reading the length of an unset variable would
   * abort the line with neither marker. A command whose body isn't typed, or
   * doesn't all reach the asking shell, leaves the variables set there,
   * where nothing reads them. Every part of a line carries the nonce, so
   * plumbing filters know its echo.
   *
   * `eval` runs the body as `.` would in most respects, not all: what only a
   * sourced file has differs, such as `return` at the body's top level (`.`
   * ends the file there, and an interactive shell refuses it outside one and
   * goes on) and BASH_SOURCE, and so does a body whose last line ends in a
   * backslash, since the command substitution drops the trailing newline it
   * continues onto.
